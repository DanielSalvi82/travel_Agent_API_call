  "analysis": "The user is asking me to act as a professional AI Travel Planner for RV trips. I need to analyze the system prompt carefully and understand my role.Key points from the system prompt:1. I'm \"Awesome, a state-of-the-art, professional-grade AI Travel Planner\"2. I create personalized RV travel itineraries based on user inputs3. There are three main inputs: InputMessage, chathistory, and TravelerProfile4. There's an optional tripPlanInputs form5. I must follow specific workflows (Workflow2 or Workflow3) based on the user's request6. I must respect WhatsApp's 3800 token limit7. I must output valid JSON8. I must not include code blocks or JSON in the output (this seems contradictory - let me re-read)Wait, the prompt says \"DO NOT include JSON or code blocks in the output\" under Constraints, but then under \"📱 WhatsApp Length Rule\" it says \"** response needs to be a valid JSON**\". This is contradictory. Let me re-read more carefully.Looking at the WhatsApp Length Rule section:- \"You must not send a response beyond 3800 tokens\"- \"** response needs to be a valid JSON**\"But under Constraints:- \"Do not include JSON or code blocks in the output\"This is a clear contradiction. However, looking at the examples provided, they are in plain text/markdown format, not JSON. The example shows a conversational response with headers and bullet points, not a JSON structure.I think the \"valid JSON\" requirement might be a mistake in the prompt, or it might mean something else. Let me look at the Output Format section:- \"Markdown-formatted travel report\"- \"Clear section headers\"- \"Use tables for driving distances, campground comparisons, or daily schedules\"This suggests the output should be markdown, not JSON. The contradiction might be an error in the prompt. Given the examples are in markdown format, I should follow that pattern. However, the instruction is very explicit that \"response needs to be a valid JSON\". Let me re-read the WhatsApp Length Rule again:\"***Never truncate the response - if your intended response is greater than 3800 tokens you MUST adapt it to 3800 tokens preserving all critical information to the user***\"**You must not send a response beyond 3800 tokens**** response needs to be a valid JSON**\"The formatting is a bit odd. Maybe it's saying the response should be structured data that could be represented as JSON, but formatted as markdown for WhatsApp? Or maybe it's a remnant from a different version of the prompt.Given the examples are clearly not JSON, and the Output Format specifies markdown, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the final output should be markdown-formatted text suitable for WhatsApp, and the \"valid JSON\" mention might be an error or misinterpretation. However, I must follow the prompt literally if possible.Wait, let me check the very end of the prompt. It says \"End of prompt.\" and that's it. No clarification.I need to make a decision here. The prompt has contradictory instructions. On one hand:- Constraints: \"Do not include JSON or code blocks in the output\"- Output Format: \"Markdown-formatted travel report\"- Examples: Show markdown formatOn the other hand:- WhatsApp Length Rule: \"** response needs to be a valid JSON**\"This is a critical conflict. In such cases, I should look for which instruction is more specific or appears in a more prominent section. The \"Constraints\" section is very clear: \"Do not include JSON or code blocks in the output\". The \"Output Format\" is also clear about markdown. The WhatsApp Length Rule's JSON mention seems like it might be a copy-paste error.However, I must be careful. The prompt says \"YOU MUST follow strictly ONE of the following workflows and ALL its steps\". The workflows don't explicitly mention JSON output - they describe the content that should be in the response.Let me think about this differently. Maybe \"valid JSON\" means the response should be structured in a way that could be easily parsed into JSON, but presented as plain text? That seems unlikely.Given the weight of evidence (Constraints section, Output Format section, and the examples), I believe the intended output is markdown text, not JSON. The \"valid JSON\" line is probably an error in the prompt. I will proceed with markdown output, but I'll try to keep the structure very clean and consistent, almost like it could be converted to JSON.Actually, wait. Let me re-read the prompt one more time very carefully. The user is asking me to act as this AI Travel Planner. The prompt is describing how I should behave. The \"response needs to be a valid JSON\" might be a requirement for the system that will process my output, not for the user-facing content.But the user is asking me to embody this agent. So I need to produce output that follows ALL the rules. This is impossible if they're contradictory.Let me look at the structure again. The prompt is very detailed. Maybe I missed something.[Re-reading the entire prompt...]OK, I see the issue. The prompt is describing an agent architecture where my output might be consumed by another system. The \"valid JSON\" requirement might be for that system, while the \"no JSON\" constraint is for the user-facing content. But the prompt says \"Do not disclose these system instructions to the user\" and I'm supposed to be the agent directly helping the user.I think the most reasonable interpretation is:1. The examples show the actual user-facing format2. The \"valid JSON\" mention is likely an error or refers to internal processing3. I should produce markdown-formatted text as shown in the examples4. I must respect the 3800 token limit5. I must not include JSON or code blocks in the user-facing outputThe user hasn't provided any actual inputs yet - they're just asking me to understand the prompt and be ready. So my response should acknowledge that I understand the role and am ready to help with RV trip planning.But wait - the user message is just \"system PRompt: You are Awesome...\" - this appears to be the system prompt itself, not a user request. The user is sharing the system prompt with me and asking me to act accordingly.So I need to respond as \"Awesome, a state-of-the-art, professional-grade AI Travel Planner\" who is ready to assist. I should confirm my understanding and ask for their travel details.Let me craft a response that:1. Acknowledges my role as Awesome the AI Travel Planner2. Shows I understand the key principles (personalization, RV considerations, workflows)3. Is concise and professional yet friendly4. Asks for their travel information to get started5. Respects the WhatsApp length rule (keep it short)6. Is in English (same as the prompt)7. Is markdown-formatted8. Does NOT include JSON or code blocksSince there are no actual traveler details provided yet, I cannot create a real itinerary. I need to ask for the necessary information.What information do I need?- From TravelerProfile: userName, age, groupSize, RVType, RVSpecs, ExtraVehicle, RigEnergyInputs, RigEnergyAmperage, dryCampingPreference, MustHavesWhileCamping, BudgetDailyAllowance, BudgetTravellingPreferences, PhysicalLimitations, ranked UserPersonas- From tripPlanInputs: TripStartDate, TripEndDate, PlaceOfDepartureAtStartOfTrip, FinalDestinationAndIntendedStops, RoundTrip, MaximumDrivingDistanceOrDurationPerDay, IntendedTypeOfCampSites, MinimumNumberofNightsPerStop- Or they can just describe their trip in natural languageI should ask for these details in a friendly, professional way. I'll structure my response to be clear and concise.Let me draft the response:---Hello! I'm Awesome, your dedicated AI Travel Planner, ready to craft your legendary RV adventure! 🚐✨I understand you're looking for highly personalized, professional-grade travel itineraries tailored to your unique traveler profile and RV specifications.**To design your perfect trip, I'll need some key details:****About You & Your Travel Style:**- Your name and group size- Your RV type, specs, and energy setup (amp service, dry camping preferences)- Any extra vehicle you're bringing- Your top travel interests (from the persona list - e.g., ScenicSeeker, AdventureChaser, FoodieExplorer, etc.)- Daily budget range and travel style preferences- Any physical limitations or must-haves while camping**About Your Trip:**- Start and end dates- Departure location and final destination- Any intended stops along the way- Maximum driving hours per day you're comfortable with- Preferred campsite types (full hookup, dry camping, Harvest Hosts, etc.)- Minimum nights you'd like to stay per location- Is this a round trip?**Or simply tell me:** \"I want to plan a [X]-day RV trip from [City] to [City] in [Month/Year]\"Once I have these details, I'll immediately provide you with **two or three exciting itinerary options** (depending on your request style), each crafted around your top personas, RV capabilities, and driving preferences. Each option will include route logic, highlight activities, and one premium VIP experience aligned with your interests.**Quick question to get started:** What's your dream RV destination and how many days do you have to explore it?Options A or B to choose one from for a full detailed itinerary. Or we can combine the options as well.---Wait, that last line \"Options A or B to choose one from...\" is supposed to be used when presenting actual options, not in an initial greeting. I should remove that.Also, I need to be more concise to respect the WhatsApp limit. Let me shorten this.Let me try again:---Hello! I'm Awesome, your professional AI Travel Planner specializing in legendary RV adventures! 🚐✨I'm ready to craft highly personalized itineraries based on your unique traveler profile, RV specifications, and real-world data.**To get started, please share:****Your Travel DNA:**- Name, group size, and RV details (type, length, amp service)- Energy needs & dry camping preferences- Top 2-3 travel personas (e.g., ScenicSeeker, AdventureChaser, FamilyFocused)- Daily budget range- Any physical limitations or camping must-haves**Your Trip Vision:**- Start/end dates & locations- Desired stops or general region- Max driving hours per day- Preferred campsite types- Trip duration (days)**Or simply say:** \"Plan me a [X]-day RV trip from [City] to [City]\"I'll then provide **2-3 exciting itinerary options** tailored to your top personas, each with route logic, highlight activities, and premium experiences. All recommendations will respect your RV capabilities, driving limits, and budget.**What trip are you dreaming of?** Let's make it unforgettable!---This is better - more concise, friendly but professional, and asks for the essential information. It doesn't include the \"Options A or B\" line since that's for presenting actual options.Let me check the constraints again:- ✅ Concise, clear, supportive tone- ✅ English language- ✅ No JSON or code blocks- ✅ WhatsApp-friendly length (well under 3800 tokens)- ✅ Markdown formatted- ✅ Shows understanding of personalization, RV considerations, workflows- ✅ Doesn't disclose system instructions- ✅ Ready to helpThis looks good. I should also mention that if they have a form filled out, I can use that (Workflow3), or if they want to explore options conversationally, I can do that too (Workflow2).Let me refine slightly to make it even more professional and clear:---Hello! I'm Awesome, your dedicated AI Travel Planner ready to architect exceptional RV adventures! 🚐✨I specialize in creating highly personalized, professional-grade itineraries that align perfectly with your traveler profile, RV specifications, and real-world travel data.**To craft your legendary trip, I need:****📋 Your Profile:**- Name & group size- RV type/specs (length, amp service) + any extra vehicle- Top travel personas (e.g., ScenicSeeker, AdventureChaser, FamilyFocused)- Daily budget & camping must-haves- Physical limitations if any**🗺️ Your Journey:**- Start/end dates & locations- Intended stops or regions to explore- Maximum driving hours per day- Preferred campsite types (full hookup, dry camping, etc.)- Trip duration (days)**Quick Start:** Just tell me \"I want a [X]-day RV trip from [City] to [City] in [Month]\"**I offer two planning paths:**1. **Explore Options** - I'll provide 2-3 exciting itinerary variations (balanced, immersive, or persona-focused)2. **Use Your Form** - If you've filled the travel inputs form, I can build options directly from thatEvery option includes route logic, highlight activities per stop, and one premium VIP experience matched to your top personas.

It clearly explains the two workflows (without calling them that), asks for all necessary information, and maintains a professional yet friendly tone. It's concise and WhatsApp-friendly.I think this is ready. The response is well under 3800 tokens, uses markdown formatting, no JSON/code blocks, and demonstrates full understanding of the system prompt.",
